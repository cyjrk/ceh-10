CRYPTER-protects from reverse engineering
downloader-it downloads other malware,after gain accesss
dropper-installs other malware files from the system from malware package or internet
injector-injects code into other process
obfuscator-conceals the code
packer-packs all files into one to system security.
payload-a piece of software takes control of system.
malicious code - functionalities such as stealing the data and creating backdoors.



Trojan concepts
present in other program
defined by the predefined actions
create covert channel

communications path
overt-explicit or evident,,llegal channel in company network
covert-hidden


Trojan steps:

1.use trojen horse kit
2.create dropper
3.wrapper tool to install trojan
4.propagate the trojan
5.execute the dropper
6.execute the damage outline.

Evading Anitvirus Technique.

1.break them into mulitple pieces and zip them into a single file.
2.change extension
3.write u r own trojan.
4.morphing


backdoor-poisionivy
rootkit-- dropper,loader,rootkit

covertchannel
-to establish external server shell
tcp/udp/http connect|post tcp data streams



service protocol trojans
--hide data in a protocol ,tunneling


Virus
.OVL ,.EXE,.SYS,.COM,.BAT

Stages of Virus

Design -- programming language
Replication -- within target system
launch -- user perfrom action
detection -- a virus
incorporation -- assimilate defenses aganist virus
execute the damage routine -- install anitvirus update


Working Virus

Infection phase
 1.method of infection
 2.method of spreading
Attack phase -triggered events


metamorphic


creating a virus
write a virus program
using virus maker tool


Worm
exploits only cpu and memory
can be removed easily from the system rather than the virus



Malware analysis
sheep dip computer -analysis
ot has port,file,network monitors  in the ystem like controlled device

static
dynamic

procedure
1.preparing the testbed
2.static analysis
3.dynamic analysis


static
file finger printing - hash code
MD5- SHA-1

local and online -anitvirus abd virus total

strings

obfuscation method -- used packers to compress and encrypt

PEID

PE
.TECT
.RDATA
.DATA
.RSRC


DEPENDENCY

dynamically linked list
library functions
dependecy walker


malware disassembly

IDA - can reverse machine code into assembly language



Dynamic malware analysis


1.system baseling --snapshot 
2.host integrity monitoring --- snapshot before and after

registry

run
runservices
runonce
runservicesonce

\currentcontrolset\services



File and folder
SIGVERIF
used for checking the intergrithy of the files


device drivers
msinfo32-->software env ->system drivers



Virus detection methods
scanning
integrity checking --- intergrity of system sectors
interception
code emulation -- malicous code exectues in the simulation
heuristic analysis -- startic or dynamic
