vulnerability classification

1.misconfiguration
2.default installations
3 buffer overflows
4 unpatched servers
5 design flaws
6 operating system flaws
7 application flaws
  open services
  default passwords
active scan
passive scan

Types of vuln assessment

active
passive
external assessment 
internal assessment
host based assessment
network assessment
application assessment
wireless network assessment



vul management lifecycle

creating balseing
vulnerablilitu assessment 
risk assessment
remediation---->APPLY PATCHES/FIX,RCA
verfication---->DYNAMIC ANALYSIS .ATTACK SURFACE
monitor------>IMPLEMENT POLICY AND PROCEDURES,IDS IPS LOGS

VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT SOLUTIONS
product based solutions---->installed in internal network (private)
service based solutions----->offered by third party ,auditing or consulting firms,hosted inside and outside the network.

tree based assessment --->different tools for differnet servics eg:windows or linux

inference based assessment --->
scanning starts building an inverntoy protocol
which ports are attached to the services
selects vulnerbailituy and start to execute the test cases


working of vulnerability scanning solutions ------>
1.locate nodes
2.perform service discovery
3.test services for known vulnerabilites



types of vulnerability assessmnet toolss
host based -->find os services
depth assessment --->find unknown vulnerbailities  eg:fuzzers
application layer--> webservers or databses
scope assessment -->security in IT sysytem vulnerability in app and os
active /passive tools --->
action

consume resources on the network

passive

observe system data

vulnerability scoring system

base - inherent qualities
temporal -features changes during the lifetime
enviromental -features based on the particular enviorment
